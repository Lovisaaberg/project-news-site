# News Site

The assignment was to build a news site and I decided to build a page about space. 


## The problem

I started with a pen and paper and made a sketch of how I wanted the layout to be. I also made three simple sketches in Figma, one for mobile, one for tabet and one for desktop. Next step was to start with the code. 

Whenever there was a problem I first read and watched the guides, or googled it. And then tried it in code until it worked. 

If I had more time I would like to make it look more like a real webiste. More interactive with working links, dropdown menus and so on.


## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
